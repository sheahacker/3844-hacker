<h3>Why the V-Shape is important</h3>
<p>The V-Shape contains two different legs of the V. When they come together they create the final part of the VT-shape. The first leg contains Informal Community Based Experiential Learning, which refers to aspects such as clubs and community service, both here at Virginia Tech, and out in the world before and after college. The second leg contains Guided Experiential Learning, which regards aspects such as internships, co-ops, research opportunities, capstone experiences, field study, and study abroad experiences. Bringing these final two legs together allows for a well-rounded experience.</p>
<h3>How we incorporated the V-shape</h3>
<p>We took the idea of a Tasty&copy; recipe video and tried to make the V-shaped student concept easier to understand by comparing each aspect to an ingredient in a recipe for a Chocolate Chip cookie. When you are baking cookies from scratch, having all the ingredients is necessary for proper cooking. If you take one ingredient out, you won't be able to make chocolate chip cookies. Our video was meant to show that you need all the aspects of the V-shape to help make your college experience well rounded. The only ingredient we didn't consider necessary was chocolate chips, which is why we compared them to study abroad experiences. Chocolate chips surely enhance the flavor of a cookie, and many prefer them in their cookie rather than without, but they aren't completely necessary for the recipe. Just like the chocolate chips, study abroad experiences aren't completely necessary. Many don't have the means to study abroad, but that doesn't mean their college experience and their fit into the VT-shaped student are in any way disadvantaged compared to others.</p>
<p>Overall, our video reflects the V parts of the VT-shaped student because we used the recipe comparisons to help make the two legs of the V more understandable in terms of how they are necessary to each other and within the VT-shaped student.</p>
