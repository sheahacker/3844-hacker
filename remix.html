									<p>&quot;…Every society has left a certain bit of its culture free for the taking—free societies more fully than unfree, perhaps, but all societies to some degree.&quot; - <em>Free Culture</em> by Lawrence Lessig</p>
									<p>&quot;Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now. That building is always and everywhere at least partially done without permission and without compensating the original creator. &quot; - <em>Free Culture</em> by Lawrence Lessig</p>
									<p>&quot;…it takes just a second’s reflection to realize that there is plenty of value out there that ‘property’ doesn’t capture. I don’t mean ‘money can’t buy you love,’but rather, value that is plainly part of a process of production, including commercial as well as noncommercial production.&quot; - <em>Free Culture</em> by Lawrence Lessig</p>
									<p>&quot;Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less.&quot; - <em>Free Culture</em> by Lawrence Lessig</p>
									<p>&quot;Encyclopedic enterprise has not kept pace with material progress. These observers realize that modern facilities of transport, radio, and photographic reproduction and so forth are rendering practicable a much more fully succinct and accessible assembly of fact and ideas than was ever possible before.&quot; - <u>World Brain</u> by H.G. Wells</p>
									<p>&quot;A T-shaped individual has deep knowledge of a discipline and/or way of thinking, often seen in higher education as a student's major. This is complemented by breadth in a variety of disciplines and ways of thinking coupled with crosscutting skills such as communication, project management, and critical thinking.&quot; - &quot;VT-shaped Student&quot; from Provost website</p>
									<p>&quot;The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics.&quot; - <em>Beyond Boundaries</em> website description</p>
									<p>&quot;A flexible approach enables students and faculty to be purpose-driven in curricular design and research, thus addressing the complex needs of communities and society at large as they arise.&quot; - <em>Beyond Boundaries</em> website description</p>
									<p>&quot;Liberal and practical education are not so much two different things as they are two distinct but interrelated parts of the same thing. In its traditional sense, the term “liberal” in “liberal arts” ought not be understood to have any particular political valence, beyond its commitment to transformation—education is neither Republican nor Democratic. It does, however, have a civic valence, the civitas that implies obligation to the community, to the welfare and well-being of a community. Liberal education involves being able to balance a free range of inquiry alongside the needs and obligations of the community.&quot; - &quot;Liberal arts education and the VT-shaped learner&quot; by Elizabeth Spiller</p>
									<p>&quot;The concept of VT-shaped learning is more than a philosophy of education; it’s the very foundation of our college.&quot; - Monica Kimbrell, from &quot;New program to highlight enrichment opportunities for students.&quot;</p>
									<p>&quot;VT-shaped knowledge: The Virginia Tech educational experience is typified by four elements: diving deep into an academic discipline, solving big problems with an interdisciplinary team, gaining and applying knowledge in real-world settings, and living to serve others. &quot; - &quot;Buzz terms&quot; section from the interview with Provost Rikakis.</p>
									<p>&quot;The many successes of our alumni provide perhaps the strongest possible testament to the ways in which Virginia Tech’s programs across the liberal arts give our students the tools to understand the human component to any equation.&quot; - &quot;Liberal arts education and the VT-shaped learner&quot; by Elizabeth Spiller</p>
