									<h3>Rip, Mix, Burn</h3>
									<p>The first four quotes on my <a href="remix.html">Remix page</a> help to describe the idea of &quot;Rip, Mix, Burn.&quot; This idea didn't make much sense to me at first, but finding and analyzing quotes for this assignment helped to make it clear.</p>
									<p>&quot;Rip, Mix, Burn&quot; helps to describe the idea that all information created is meant to be borrowed or used to some degree or at some point. Like Lessig says, free culture is there to be borrowed and used, and in that way it can help expand other cultures.
<h3>VT-Shaped</h3>
<p>I find the idea of a VT shaped student to be very interesting. I had never heard of a T-shaped student, in the first place, so it’s fascinating to see how they incorporated Virginia Tech’s student’s love for service and Ut Prosim.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to me how it starts out simple, but then grows in a complex diagram that brings together all that you need to be a VT-shaped student. Tim Sands has said he wants students to graduate as VT-shaped, but I like to think that this is always a work in progress and that a student will keep growing into that VT shape, as long as they continue to learn.</p>
<p>Being a VT shaped student means that you are disciplined and knowledged in your craft, while also bringing in the factors of service and Ut Prosim, and experiential learning, all aspects of Virginia Tech. I don’t believe that being a VT-shaped student has to end at graduation, but that as long as we continue to work hard, we will continue to better ourselves.</p>
<p>The last seven quotes I chose on the <a href="remix.html">Remix page</a> explain to me what it really means to be a VT-shaped student, and what the Virginia Tech faculty wants for the community. They also help to describe how the VT-shaped student concept will work throughout the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, and how liberal education is not a politcal matter, but one that balances &quot; needs and obligations of the community.&quot;
<h3>Working with HTML</h3>
<p>I surprised myself over the past few weeks. When I first came into this class, I thought coding and writing in HTML was going to make this the worst class I’ve ever taken. But, as I worked on the assignments and challenges, I found that I actually enjoy coding very much. I may not be the best at it, and I still have to search on google when I forget what some tags are, but I’ve definitely gotten better at it. I’m glad I was required to take this class, because I probably wouldn’t have taken it otherwise, and then I would have missed out on learning a skill that I could use in the future.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t consider coding something that I want to do for a career, but I do believe it’s a good skill to have. I now have the means and resources to post my content online if I ever wanted to do so. Although I am a writing major, both creative and professional, I still am struggling with allowing others to read what I’ve written, especially in front of me. This may sound odd, but having the ability to put what I’ve written online makes me feel more comfortable about sharing it.</p>
<h3>What Digital Writing Means to Me</h3>
<p>When I first thought of digital writing, I thought more of writing in Microsoft Word, and emailing or printing whatever you had typed up. HTML had never occurred to me as being a form of digital writing, because I never thought about what it takes to publish writing on the internet in the form of a website or webpage. I now realize that Microsoft Word is not your friend in every case, and that publishing writing on the Internet is not as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>My idea of what digital writing is has changed since I started in this class. Writing an essay for a class for Microsoft Word is not what I would consider digital writing, but I know realize that writing in HTML to publish on a website is a form of it.</p>
<p>Although I never had much use for it before, I now realize that it is a good skill to have, and one that I can use in the future.</p>
