<p>For my design, I created a website page that will help non-English majors find their own love for writing. No matter what major you're in, writing and English plays a part, no matter how small. Many students in technology based majors struggle with writing, or downright just don't like it. Even though they are required to take first year writing courses for their CLE's, many students let their writing skills die out after that and never look back at it again. I created a website that would give steps and help students write, so they realize that it's not as bad as it seems when you take the time to do it. </p>
<p>As you can see on the sketched out design above, there will be a dropdown menu bar that helps students narrow down what they want to write. Each different category has a number of subcategories, which help the student to write their essay by giving them specific steps to go by. Many students technology or science based majors are used to taking steps, and giving them directions to follow can help them take the proper steps to writing correctly. Since the website allows students to write directly into the website, and it tracks their process, it will contain a grammar check feature, which helps to make sure their grammar is perfect. </p>
<p>This is an affirmative design in regards to the VT Shaped Student model. Because the VT Shaped Student model focuses on making students more well rounded and knowledgeable in their fields, this helps to make sure they have even the little things covered, as they will learn how to write better and can project those skills into their selected fields. </p>
<p>Personally, I really liked this idea for a website because I like editing and helping people write. I enjoy editing more than I enjoy writing, so I think making a website that is so advanced to edit as a user writes is a really amazing concept.</p>
