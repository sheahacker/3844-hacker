<p>For my design, I have created a surgical team to represent the components of the VT-Shaped Student. I had originally come up with a different idea in my mind, but between my final projects and exams, I procrastinated by watching a lot of the ABC drama, Grey's Anatomy. In doing so, I came up with this idea. Each surgeon represents their own specialty, while also representing one component of the VT-Shaped Student. The patient being treated by the team represents the whole of the VT-Shaped Student. The idea is that the patient will be completely taken care of because they have a complete surgical team which specializes in every aspect of their health, just like how the VT-Shaped Student is complete because it contains all necessary components.</p>

<p>The <b>vertical</b> part of the T is represented by the <b>orthopedic surgeon</b> on the team. Orthopedic surgeons deal with the muscular and skeletal systems of the body, which are really the initial structure of the body, just like the vertical part of the T creates the initial structure of the VT-Shaped Student. </p>

<p>The <b>horizontal</b> part of the T is represented by the <b>general surgeon</b>. A general surgeon works with more than one organ, so they have to know how to work with and treat many different conditions that can arise. The horizontal part of the T also has many different components to it, just like the many organs of general surgery. Within the horizontal, the different components include general education like CLE's, interdisciplinary research, and working with destination areas, which all work together, just like the organs do. </p>

<p>The <b>enhanced T</b> is represented by the <b>cardiothoracic surgeon</b>. This surgeon works with the heart and lungs, which are the organs that help keep our bodies going by allowing oxygen to enter the body and pumping it to the rest of our organs so they run correctly. The enhanced T incorporated cross-cutting technology and science, which I saw as a good comparison because cardiothoracic surgery is a cross-cutting field. </p>

<p>The <b>v-shape</b> is represented by the <b>neurosurgeon</b>. Neurosurgeons work with organs like the spine and brain, and the nervous system. All these come together to effect the quality of life very drastically. I compared this to the v-shape because the two legs of the V come together with many different components, such as study abroad, community service, field studies, clubs/organizations and research, which all can effect a student's quality of life at college. </p>

<p>Finally, the entire <b>VT-Shaped Student</b> is represented by the <b>patient</p>. Let's assume this patient is in bad shape. The patient has all the organs and systems detailed above, but there is not one surgeon who can treat it all. That's why they need an entire surgical team to treat all their injuries and essentially lead them to survival. I compared the patient to the VT-Shaped student because without all the components (vertical, horizontal, enhanced T, and v-shape) it would cease to exist. </p>

<p>While I don't see myself having a future in medicine, I enjoyed this comparison because it's something that really interests me. When I was in high school, I wanted to be a doctor (before I wanted to be a vet. I had big dreams. Kind of.). I eventually realized I lacked enough discipline to achieve those dreams, which I was totally content with, but I never stopped being interested in it, which is why I really liked this idea. It also works as affirmative design, because it proves and works with the VT-Shaped Student to create a surgical team as well rounded as the VT-Shaped Student itself.</p>
