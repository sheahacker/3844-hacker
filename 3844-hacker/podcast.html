<h2>You can find the Podcast to a T <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shea-hacker/t-shaped-podcast"><u>here</u>.</a></h2>
<h3>Why the T-shape is important</h3>
<p>Before the VT-Shaped student was an idea, the T-shaped student was already in place. The T-shaped student is knowledgable in their field, and has advanced skills in twenty-first century technology.</p>
<p>In our podcast, we each discussed how our specific majors have been tailored to give us the most advanced lessons in technology, even though our majors aren't necessarily technology-based.</p>
<h3>How we incorporated the Enhanced T</h3>
<p>This podcast reflects the T parts of the VT shaped model because of the conversational methods we to describe each of our personal experiences and how they relate and fit into the model. By beginning the main discussion of the podcast with explaining what the enhanced cross of the T is, we can then easily transition and better explain what it means to us. Between all of our different majors, minors and double majors, the cross of the T means something different to each of us, because of our different experiences. We also found it extremely important to discuss specifically how technology works for us, within the context of the T.</p>
<p>The enhanced T contains both aspects of the vertical and horizontal parts of the T. This includes aspects regarding the departmental and disciplinary strengths within the vertical, and general education within the horizontal. The horizontal helps to enhance the development of destination areas. We also discussed our first few semesters at Virginia Tech and the struggles we faced trying to get out feet on the ground, and compared that to how we fit in the T-shape now.</p>
<p>Overall, throughout our recorded conversation, we used our personal experiences to compare how the enhanced T-shape is different for everyone.</p>
