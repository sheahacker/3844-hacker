<h3>A love for service</h3>
<p>Part of the reason I came to Virginia Tech was because of Ut Prosim. When you walked on campus, it didn’t feel like any other campus, and that’s because it’s not. No other school centers itself so much around the service of others. The students at Tech aren’t just any other college students; the way the serve their peers and the community sets them apart, and that’s one of the reasons I wanted to go here.</p>
<p>Attending Virginia Tech also means taking part in service projects that happen over the course of the year. I’ve participated in Greeks Giving Back and Relay for Life, which I plan to do again in the future. I’ll also be participating in The Big Event this spring. I’m also in a sorority, Alpha Chi Omega, which, like many people think, is not all about partying and &quot;paying for your friends.&quot; We also do a bunch of service projects on our own, and give back to the community. Just last semester, I participated in multiple philanthropies where we supported many causes like my sorority’s own philanthropy, domestic violence awareness, where, in a 3 day event we raised nearly $30,000 dollars for the Woman’s Resource Center of the New River Valley.</p>
<p>As President Sands says in the quote pictured above, VT-shaped students are well-knowledged in their majors, while also having a commitment to serving. I hope to one day use writing to help serve others, in order to bring everything I’ve learned together as one.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>While I've said I would like to write in the future, over the semester I've noticed that I enjoy editing a lot as well. But one of my major beliefs is that in order to edit well, one must also know how to write. The two go hand in hand, so my goal is to use both writing and editing in my life, possibly as a career. </p>
