<h3>A bit about me</h3>
<p>Hello there! My name today is Happy Hokie, I’m a sophomore at Virginia Tech. I’m currently double-majoring in Professional &amp; Technical Writing, and Creative Writing. You’re probably thinking that I love to write and that it’s all I’ve ever done with my life, considering I’m double majoring in two different kinds. While I do love it, and I’ve always written on the side, I didn’t start out college this way. I was accepted to Tech in the College of Life and Agricultural Sciences, with a major in Animal and Poultry Science, very different from what I’m in now. In high school, I had a passion for animals and I thought that working with them was what I always wanted to do, so in my junior year, I set my sights on becoming a vet. When it came time to take those classes freshman year, I realized after a couple hard semesters, that having a passion for animals was one thing, while becoming a vet was another, and decided to do what made me happy, regardless if everyone I knew was telling me I wouldn’t find a job.</p>
<p>At this point, I still don’t know what I want to do exactly after college, but I know that I want to do something with writing. Whether that’s writing a book, or writing for a company, it doesn’t matter to me at this point. I’ll figure it out soon enough, and then probably change my mind again after that, like I always do.</p>
<p>This is the first digital writing course I’ve ever taken, and so far, I’m actually enjoying it. When I came to the first class, I was dreading it. Writing and coding in HTML didn’t seem fun to me, but I was required to take the class so I figured why not just get it out of the way now. But even though I came in with that mindset, my opinions on this class have definitely changed.</p>
<p>I always say that its easy to like to do something when you know how to do it or you’re good at it. While I’m not great at writing in HTML yet, I do feel I’m getting the hang of it and being decent at it makes it a lot more fun for me.</p>
<p>In this course, I’m hoping to better my skills with HTML because I feel like it’s an important skill to have, especially being a writer. If I ever want my content or writing posted online, I’ll know how to put it in HTML format which is the first step to getting it on the internet.</p>
